# Batch_52_StudentDropOut
Student Dropout Analysis for School Education using Random Forest 

This project predicts student dropout risk using Random Forest models by analyzing academic performance, attendance, socio-economic, and behavioral features. The system helps schools and institutions identify at-risk students early and take preventive actions.

🎯 Objectives

Identify key factors influencing student dropout

Predict dropout probability using machine learning

Provide visual insights through graphs and dashboards

Help institutions take timely interventions
